# pyStar

I want a module that does star-stuff. I give it data (colours, asteroseismic,
spectrocopic, etc.) and it give me results like Teff, logg, age, mass, etc.

This is an open project. If any are interested in helping feel free to contact me,
open an issue, or create a pull request.

## Installation
It's python, duh... Things you need is `python3.6` and the modules listed in the
`requirements.txt` (probably not the latest version as listed there).


## Usage
`pyStar.py` is the main module. See the example in the end of the file.

The other files are classes to deal with the responsibility for other stuff.
